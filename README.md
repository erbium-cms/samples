# Samples - The Dev Department

A sample customization for the [erbium CMS](https://github.com/erbium-cms/erbium-cms).
It assembles a department in some company that wants to have there own site in
the intranet. There should be blogging possibilities for everybody and in
addition also some voting page or talks proposals for a regular meetup.

The sample application has been initially created by using
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). We also use
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for managing our packages.

As it is usual for a app created with create-react-app, you can use the
following commands:

* `yarn start`
  Starts the development server.
* `yarn build`
  Bundles the app into static files for production.
* `yarn test`
  Starts the test runner.
* `yarn eject`
  Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and
  scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can't go back!
